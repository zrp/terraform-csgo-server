# CS: GO Server

A Terraform module to implement a CS: GO Server. The server is managed by [Linux GSM (Game Server Manager)](https://linuxgsm.com/) and deployed to EC2.

The game server will be automatically registered, and alerts will be emitted to a webhook (if provided).

> The initial setup usually takes ~30min.

## Deployment

Copy the example on `examples/complete`. Basically you need:

1. A VPC with a public subnet (we create one in the complete example).
2. A GSLT token from Steam (access https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers to generate, use app_id 730).
3. Update the configuration to match yours.
4. Run terraform init.
5. Run terraform plan.
6. Run terraform apply.
7. Wait until setup is finished.

An id_rsa.pem and an id_rsa.pub files will be created in your module root folder.

Use the id_rsa.pem to connect to the server.

## Manage the Server

* SSH into the instance using user **csgoserver** (`ssh -i id_rsa.pem csgoserver@<server ip>`);
* Manipulate the server using `./csgoserver <command>`;

## Using VNC

1. SSH into the instance
2. Run `vncpasswd`
3. Start the vncserver using `vncserver -localhost no`
4. Connect using a VNC Client (e.g. VNC Connect by RealVNC, TigerVNC, etc...) using `IP:1` and provide the password you've just configured.

## Connecting to server in Game

1. Enable Developer Console in `Settings > Game`.
2. Open the console using `'`.
3. Type `connect csgo.<provided_domain>` or `connect <instance_ip>`.

> If a password was provided, instead use `connect <ip>; password <pass>`.

## Using RCON within your server

1. Ensure you have connected to your server using the instructions above.
2. Open the in-game developer console by pressing the tilde (~) key.
3. Type `rcon_address <server_ip>` to set your rcon_address;
4. Type `rcon_password <your_password>` to set your password;
5. Confirm rcon is working by issuing `rcon status` in the console;
